"Five Fingers Death Punch"

"Wrong Side Of Heaven"

I spoke to God today, and she said that she's ashamed
What have I become? What have I done?
I spoke to the Devil today, and he swears he's not to blame
And I understood, 'cause I feel the same

Arms wide open, I stand alone
I'm no hero, and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong, I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side, the righteous side of Hell

I heard from God today, and she sounded just like me
What have I done and who have I become?
I saw the Devil today, and he looked a lot like me
I looked away, I turned away!

Arms wide open, I stand alone
I'm no hero, and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong, I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of heaven, and the righteous side, the righteous side of Hell

I'm not defending, downward descending
Falling further and further away!
Getting closer every day!

I'm getting closer every day, to the end
To the end, the end, the end
I'm getting closer every day!

Arms wide open, I stand alone
I'm no hero, and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong, I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven, and the righteous side, the righteous side of Hell
